# Requirements Engineering Tool - Technical Documentation

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+, React 18+, TypeScript
- **Backend Services**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- **AI Integration**: Gum Loop API
- **State Management**: Server Components + Context API
- **Real-time Updates**: Firebase Real-time Database

### Integration Patterns

#### Firebase Integration
- Authentication using Firebase Auth with custom claims for role management
- Firestore for structured data (requirements, metadata)
- Cloud Storage for document storage
- Cloud Functions for serverless operations and AI integration

#### Gum Loop AI Integration
- RESTful API integration via Cloud Functions
- Webhook support for async processing
- Streaming responses for real-time analysis feedback

### Security Implementation

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Document-level security rules
- API route protection

#### Data Security
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive documents
- Secure file upload with virus scanning
- Regular security audits
- GDPR compliance measures

### Performance Optimization

#### Frontend Optimization
- Static Generation for public pages
- Incremental Static Regeneration for dynamic content
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Code splitting and bundle optimization

#### Backend Optimization
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Database indexing strategy
